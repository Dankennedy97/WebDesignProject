					<p id="main">The Green Arrow, or Oliver Queen, began as a rich teenager who was marooned on an island called: Starfish Island. He spent five years on this island and developed the skills he now uses to defend his city, Star city.
					As a kid Oliver's hero was Robin Hood, and was said to be a natural archer. Oliver frequently practiced with his bow and arrows to improve his skill. His Mother and Father were mauled in a tragic safari accident and was then raised by his uncle, and later inherited the family fortune.
					He became a typical billionaire playboy that enjoyed spending money rather than earning it. It was only when he was marooned on the island did he begin to change.
